# planet_LB
A python distribution for lattice-boltzmann modelling of planetary processes

Currently has 1D (D1Q2) and 2D (D2Q9) solvers for the advection-diffusion problems, from plate cooling and contact metamorphism, to subduction zones.

Install:

pip install planet_LB

See the ipynb for usage and examples, and some 1D and 2D benchmarks.

Here's an example of the cooling of a thrust model:

Or, if subduction floats (sinks?) your boat, here's one we prepared earlier:

Full code in the ipynb directory. Enjoy. Or not. Up to you, really.
